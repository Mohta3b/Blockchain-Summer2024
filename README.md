# Description
This course is part of the Summer of Code program organized by the [ACM Student Branch of the University of Tehran](https://ut-acm.ir) during the summer of 2024. It provides an introduction to blockchain technology, cryptographic concepts, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as smart contract development using Solidity.

By the end of the course, students will have hands-on experience deploying their own ERC-20 token on the Ethereum testnet.

*This course is inspired in some parts by the cryptocurrency course taught by Dr. Bahrak and Dr. Shariat at the University of Tehran.*
